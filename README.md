# Problems-Solved-with-C
🌟 C Programming – From Zero to Hero

Welcome to my C Programming Repository, a complete collection of codes ranging from the very basics to advanced topics. This repository is built as a learning hub where I store, organize, and improve my C programming skills, while also creating a helpful reference for others exploring the language. The aim is to maintain a well-structured and compact resource that is simple, practical, and continuously growing.

📂 Repository Overview

Basics – Covers introductory programs such as printing output, variables, operators, loops, conditionals, and user-defined functions.

Intermediate – Includes arrays, pointers, strings, structures, unions, and modular programming techniques.

Advanced – Features file handling, dynamic memory allocation, data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and sorting algorithms.

Problem Solving – A set of programs focused on logical thinking, pattern printing, mathematical problems, and DSA practice.

✨ Key Features

A structured folder system for smooth navigation and clarity.

Beginner-friendly code, written with comments to explain each step.

Focus on covering core concepts that are vital for programming in C.

Constant updates as I practice more advanced topics and problem sets.

Useful as a quick reference for revision, interviews, or academic practice.

🎯 Goals of This Repository

Strengthen my own fundamentals in C programming.
